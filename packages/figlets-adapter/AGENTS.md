# figlets adapter — Codex orchestration

Thin orchestration layer for Codex CLI over the figlets-mcp tools.
All deterministic Figma analysis happens inside the MCP tools — this file defines when to call what, how to handle ambiguity, and what to surface to the user.

---

## Prerequisites

1. figlets-mcp server running and configured in your MCP config (see `docs/mcp-config-examples.md`)
2. For live Figma data: figma-bridge-plugin open in Figma Desktop (port 1337)

---

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `sync_figma_data` | Triggers the bridge plugin to extract the full DS snapshot and save it to `.local/figma-data.json` | Before any analysis when the user wants fresh data from Figma |
| `detect_design_system` | Analyzes the snapshot: collections, variables, styles, inferred capabilities | After syncing, or when a snapshot already exists on disk |
| `inspect_component` | Extracts layout, variants, and properties of the currently selected Figma node | When the user wants to inspect a specific component or frame |
| `audit_tokens` | Reports unaliased values, duplicate tokens, and naming violations in the snapshot | When the user wants a token health check |

---

## Workflows

### Detect design system
1. Ask: "Sync fresh data from Figma first, or analyze the existing snapshot?"
2. If fresh: call `sync_figma_data`
3. Call `detect_design_system`
4. Summarize: collection names, variable counts by type, text and effect style counts, inferred capabilities

### Inspect a component
1. Ask the user to select the target node in Figma Desktop, then wait for confirmation
2. Call `inspect_component`
3. Summarize: name, type, layout mode, padding and spacing, variants, key children and their bindings

### Audit tokens
1. Ask: "Sync fresh data first, or audit the existing snapshot?"
2. If fresh: call `sync_figma_data`
3. Call `audit_tokens`
4. Report violations by type: unaliased values → duplicate tokens → naming inconsistencies
5. Surface the highest-impact fixes first

### Full design system health check
1. Call `sync_figma_data`
2. Call `detect_design_system`
3. Call `audit_tokens`
4. Deliver one combined summary: capabilities detected, variable and style counts, violation breakdown, recommended next steps

## Error handling

| Symptom | Cause | What to tell the user |
|---------|-------|-----------------------|
| `sync_figma_data` returns 503 | Bridge plugin not connected | "Open the figlets bridge plugin in Figma Desktop and try again." |
| `inspect_component` returns empty selection | Nothing selected in Figma | "Select a component or frame in Figma, then try again." |
| `detect_design_system` returns no collections | No snapshot on disk | "Run a sync first to pull data from Figma." |
| `audit_tokens` returns no violations | Clean token set or no snapshot | Confirm snapshot exists; if it does, report the all-clear to the user |

---

## Rules

- Never embed design system analysis logic in the prompt — call the MCP tools instead
- Never ask the user for variable names, token values, or collection names — the tools extract these from Figma
- Never call `inspect_component` without first confirming the user has selected a node in Figma
- Never call `detect_design_system` or `audit_tokens` without checking whether a sync is needed first
- Never present raw JSON tool output directly — always summarize into plain language
